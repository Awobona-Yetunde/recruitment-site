            Discover the difference an experienced data entry team can make in
            the way you do business. Since our inception in the late 1990s, the
            nature and scope of our services have changed significantly. In 2000
            we were one of the first, if not the first, company to utilize an
            entirely remote data entry workforce doing work over the internet
            while connected to our private network. From that, we progressed to
            performing <strong>data verification</strong> and
            <strong>Internet research</strong>
            projects, as well as <strong>data entry staffing</strong> and
            management performing work on our clientâ€™s networks.
