                      When we design the data entry program for each project, we
                      use field validations extensively, along with table
                      lookups, formulas, and data-type restrictions. This
                      includes standard or custom check-digit formulas, city,
                      state, and zip code lookups from Postal Code tables, as
                      well as any type of customer-specific data (for example,
                      vendor or customer lists, and product or parts lists).

                  <p className="text-black mb-4">
                    Over the years, we have determined initial accuracy ranges
                    from 96%-98% depending on the type of information (numeric
                    or alpha-numeric). When the nature of the application
                    demandes even higher levels of accuracy, selected fields or
                    entire documents can be verified. This applies to recognized
                    text from OCR/ICR/OMR engines, as well as data that is
                    keyed. After data has been keyed once (or recognized), it is
                    keyed again by a second independent operator. As each
                    keystroke is made, the system flags any differences, which
                    are then verified and corrected by the second operator, or
                    sent to a third, senior-level operator for resolution.

                      Undeliverable mail is costly, especially for organizations
                      handling large direct mail programs. To reduce this cost
                      and assure the cleanest address data possible, we utilize
                      CorrectAddressÂ® from Experian
                      (https://www.experian.com/small-business/address-validation)
                      to verify, correct, and format the addresses entered in
                      accordance with USPS CASS standards. As each address is
                      keyed, it is instantaneously validated against a database
                      of all current US addresses and normalized to USPS mailing
                      standards.

                      As an add-on, be sure to ask how we can append latitude
                      and longitude to your address records based on the Zip+4.
                      This lets you determine which of your business locations
                      is closest to each person in your database, which is a
                      valuable tool for any business owner.
