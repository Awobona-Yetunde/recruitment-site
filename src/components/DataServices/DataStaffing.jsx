                Using this approach, all source documents, processing, and
                resulting data are retained on the client network, eliminating
                the risks associated with transferring documents and data
                between companies.

                The client provides login IDs for selected Axion staff who
                perform the necessary tasks required. Sometimes, the process
                requires simple data entry from images displayed within the
                client system. In other cases, Axion staff are required to find
                the data based on client instructions and to then enter or
                correct data in the client system. Once a record is complete,
                the data is immediately available to the client.

                As with all client engagements, a dedicated Axion Project
                Manager is assigned to fully understand the project
                requirements, train Axion staff, and manage the work. In some
                cases, the client prefers to train not only the Project Manager
                but also participate in data entry staff training. If not
                available from the client, the Project Manager prepares written
                instructions, which are approved by the client and then used for
                staff training and reference.

              <p className="text-black text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
                The Project Manager communicates regularly, sometimes daily,
                with the clientâ€™s primary point of contact on such matters as
                expected workloads, progress, unexpected problems, and quality
                or turnaround issues.
